# Before you start sequencing

In our experience, there is a lot to be gained from spending a bit of time on clarifying your goals. Why do you want to do metagenomic sequencing? What are you hoping to achieve?

## What is your research question? 

A common pitfall in metagenomics is to send off your sample(s) without a plan. If you reached the point where you want to do metagenomic sequencing, there is a reason for it. Writing down specific aims may help clarify if your dreams are of the wild kind, or actually achievable (expectation management). 

For example, "We want to do AMR surveillance in wastewater" is an admirable goal, but from a metagenomic analysis perspective, it is not sufficiently specific. Are you interested in following the increase/decrease in certain genes of concern? Do you want to link genes to their host? Do you want to discover new variants? The answers to these questions should inform your sampling and sequencing strategy, as well as the analysis strategy afterwards.

## Experimental design. 

How many samples do you need? Time-line? Environment? 

Think carefully about confounders. Sample collection (number of samples, time-points). This is not specific to metagenomics, but just a generel reminder.

## Controls/contamination

Depending on your research question, you are likely end up in a situation where you have to defend whether your result is a real or could be just a contaminant. Classical shotgun metagenomics is untargeted, so highly sensitive to contamination. If you are doing metagenomics for diagnostic insights, controls are critically important (and it cant be fixed afterwards). 

## Sample preparation. 

This is a step which in our opinion is highly underestimated. Typically, you have a specific target (or type of organism) in mind when you do metagenomic sequencing. If that is the case, you should consider sample enrichment/depletion strategies.

On the other hand, if you wish to be quantitative, you must make sure to manipulate your sample as little as possible. You may also consider adding spike-ins to facilitate quantification. At the very least, you must take careful measurements of your samples.

## Sequencing strategy

Illumina or nanopore? Something else? WHich sequencing depth do you need? Do you need long reads? Depends on your research question.
