# Before you start sequencing

In our experience, there is a lot to be gained from spending a bit of time on clarifying your goals. Why do you want to do metagenomic sequencing? What are you hoping to achieve?

## What is your research question? 

A common pitfall in metagenomics is to send off your sample(s) without a plan. 

Do you have a specific question (or are you just sort of thinking that you will find out later?). Writing down specific aims may help clarify if your dreams are of the wild kind, or actually achievable (expectation management). "We want to look at AMR is wastewater" is not sufficiently specific. 

## Experimental design. 

How many samples do you need? Time-line? Environment? Think carefully about confounders. Sample collection (number of samples, time-points)

## Controls/contamination

You will likely end up in a situation where you have to defend whether your result is a real or could be just a contaminant. Controls are important (and it cant be fixed afterwards)

## Sample preparation. 

How should the sample be collected, and how should it be prepared for sequencing? You may be interested in a specific part of your sample, if so you should consider ways to enrich for it (or deplete for the part you are not interested in). On the other hand, if you wish to be quantitative, you need to think about adding spike-ins or other measurements

## Sequencing strategy

Illumina or nanopore? Something else? WHich sequencing depth do you need?
