# Thoughts on metagenomic analysis on wastewater samples

## Why wastewater? 
Wastewater is of increasing interest for pathogen surveillance. In many places, surveillance using fx qPCR is already implemented (fx. SARS-CoV-2, influenza). Another target is to look for AMR. 

Wastewater is attractive as a target, because samples can be collected without involving humans directly. If correctly collected it can also be unbiased, i.e. a representative sample of the human population targeted.

## Challenges with wastewater

- The main challenge working with wastewater is the extreme complexity of the samples. From a pathogen surveillance perspective, we may be primarily interested in fecal matter from humans - however, wastewater contain a lot of other things.
