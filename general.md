**Metagenomics for Beginners**

Metagenomics is the study of genetic material directly from environmental samples without the need to grow organisms in the lab. By sequencing all DNA or RNA in a sample, metagenomics allows us to see the entire community of microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) and understand their roles in health, disease and the environment.

**Why is metagenomics important / What can metagenomics show us?**

What microbes are present in a sample?
(water, soil, animal gut, human respiratory tract)
How do microbial communities change over time or under stress?
(after therapeutic treatment, during infection outbreaks, or in polluted environments)
Are there pathogens that could spill over from animals to humans?
(key to the One Health approach, which links human, animal, and environmental health)
What genes are microbes carrying?
(antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence factors, metabolic capabilities)
How do microbes interact with each other and with their host?
(protective roles of gut microbiota vs. harmful effects of dysbiosis)

**Metagenomics in One Health / public health context**
Tracking emerging and reemerging pathogens (detecting viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites in wildlife, livestock, environment and humans before outbreaks spread).
Antimicrobial resistance surveillance (identifying resistance genes in hospitals, farms and wastewater).
Food and water safety (monitoring contamination, safe consumption).
Environmental health (measuring the impact of pollution, climate change and land use on microbial ecosystems)???
Microbiome and health (understanding how microbial communities affect immunity, nutrition, and disease risk).

**Learning objectives/outcomes (each module can be a folder in the repo with a tutorial, data, example checklist etc…**

Module 1: Introduction to metagenomics (including pros and cons)

You will be able to:
- Define metagenomics and distinguish shotgun vs. amplicon approaches.
- Explain strengths/limitations (biases, depth, cost, turnaround).
- Map metagenomics applications to One Health/public health questions.

Module 2: Study design and sample types

You will be able to:
-Match research questions to sample types (soil, water, swabs, feces, vectors, air).
-Plan sampling strategy (replicates, controls, blanks, time series).
-Specify essential metadata (where/when/host/exposure/processing).

Module 3: Sample preparation and nucleic acid quality assessment

You will be able to:
-Describe extraction basics for DNA/RNA; avoid common inhibitors.
-Assess yield/integrity/purity (Qubit, NanoDrop, RIN/DIN).
-Decide when to enrich/deplete (host depletion, rRNA depletion).

Module 3a: Sample preparation per microbe type (probably 3 and 3a will be merged into one, or we can have separate files for bits and pieces/nuances for different samples/microbes

You will be able to:
-Contrast extraction/enrichment strategies per microbe class (e.g., capsid-protected viral nucleic acids, tough fungal cell walls).
-Choose targeted vs. untargeted approaches when one group is low abundance.
-Recognize biosafety and contamination-control considerations per sample type.

Module 4: Sequencing technologies

You will be able to:
-Compare Illumina, ONT, and PacBio for metagenomics (read length, error, cost).
-Select depth/coverage for your objective (profiling vs. assembly).
-Plan multiplexing and barcoding strategies.

Module 5: Library preparation and library quality assessment 

You will be able to:
-Outline library prep steps (fragmentation, adapters, indexing).
-Interpret library QC (size distributions, molarity, contamination).
-Identify failure modes and corrective actions.

Module 6: Sequence data quality control 

Module 7: Taxonomic profiling 

Module 8: Assembly and binning

Module 9: Functional profiling

Module 10: Antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes

Modules 11: Visualization and interpretation

Module 12: Reproducibility and reporting
Module 13: Hardware specs, clusters, online platforms
Maybe include a tutorial pipeline (with a well curated dataset, replicating the results from the study and explaining the output)
