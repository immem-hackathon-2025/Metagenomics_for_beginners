Metagenomics for Beginners
Metagenomics is the study of genetic material directly from environmental samples without the need to grow organisms in the lab. By sequencing all DNA or RNA in a sample, metagenomics allows us to see the entire community of microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) and understand their roles in health, disease and the environment.
Why is metagenomics important / What can metagenomics show us?
What microbes are present in a sample?
(water, soil, animal gut, human respiratory tract)
How do microbial communities change over time or under stress?
(after therapeutic treatment, during infection outbreaks, or in polluted environments)
Are there pathogens that could spill over from animals to humans?
(key to the One Health approach, which links human, animal, and environmental health)
What genes are microbes carrying?
(antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence factors, metabolic capabilities)
How do microbes interact with each other and with their host?
(protective roles of gut microbiota vs. harmful effects of dysbiosis)
Metagenomics in One Health / public health context
Tracking emerging and reemerging pathogens (detecting viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites in wildlife, livestock, environment and humans before outbreaks spread).
Antimicrobial resistance surveillance (identifying resistance genes in hospitals, farms and wastewater).
Food and water safety (monitoring contamination, safe consumption).
Environmental health (measuring the impact of pollution, climate change and land use on microbial ecosystems)???
Microbiome and health (understanding how microbial communities affect immunity, nutrition, and disease risk).
